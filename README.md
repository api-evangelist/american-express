### American Express Token Service (AETS) API
The American Express Token Service (AETS) API is a powerful tool that allows developers to securely tokenize cardholder data, providing a layer of security for online transactions. By generating unique tokens that represent a customer's payment information, the API helps to reduce the risk of data breaches and fraud. This technology works by replacing sensitive data with randomly generated tokens, ensuring that the original payment details are never exposed during transactions. The AETS API enables merchants to securely process payments without storing or transmitting sensitive cardholder information, ultimately enhancing the security and trustworthiness of online payments.
