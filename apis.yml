      The American Express Token Service (AETS) API is a powerful tool that
      allows developers to securely tokenize cardholder data, providing a layer
      of security for online transactions. By generating unique tokens that
      represent a customer's payment information, the API helps to reduce the
      risk of data breaches and fraud. This technology works by replacing
      sensitive data with randomly generated tokens, ensuring that the original
      payment details are never exposed during transactions. The AETS API
      enables merchants to securely process payments without storing or
      transmitting sensitive cardholder information, ultimately enhancing the
      security and trustworthiness of online payments.

      American Express Enhanced Authorization (EA) is a fraud prevention tool
      that helps protect cardholders and merchants from unauthorized

      decisions, allowing them to quickly identify and block potentially
      fraudulent transactions. By using EA, American Express can minimize the
      risk of fraud for both cardholders and merchants, providing a more secure
      and seamless payment experience.
